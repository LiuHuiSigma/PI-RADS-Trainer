                  PI-RADS Trainer is an open-source platform facilitating reading
                  and reporting of prostate MRI independent of a radiology workstation,
                  leveraging publicly available datasets, and accessible at any time.
                  <br><br>
                  For each case, the application provides a user with 4 separate MR
                  image stacks including T2-weighted images, ADC map, high b-value DWI,
                  and Ktrans map obtained from contrast-enhanced imaging. The user places
                  a fiducial marker on a suspicious region of the prostate, and may
                  select the "report" option to be directed to a user interface for
                  reporting using PI-RADS v2. After entering the finding anatomical
                  location, and scores for each image, the user may submit the report.
                  After submission, the application gives the user a feedback message
                  including projection of the biopsy locations on the 4 image views and
                  their histologically proven outcomes. Relative distances (in mm) between
                  the user-defined findings and the biopsy locations are also calculated
                  and displayed to the user.
